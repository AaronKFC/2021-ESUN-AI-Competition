## Data Prepared

You should put the data and code as the structure below.

```
+- train
  +- all // Put all the training images here
Data Analysis.ipynb
Data Preprocessing.ipynb
FineTuning ResNet18.ipynb
training data dict.txt
```
Run Data Preprocessing.ipynb to split training data into training data and validation data.

## Data Analysis

Run Data Analysis.ipynb to display some feature from the data.

## FineTuning and Evaluation

Run FineTuning ResNet18.ipynb to finetune ResNet18 with pretrained weight (pretrain via ImageNet).
